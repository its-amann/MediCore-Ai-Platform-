## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install react-markdown remark-gfm react-syntax-highlighter jspdf html2canvas jszip file-saver date-fns @mui/x-date-pickers framer-motion lucide-react
```

## Usage Example

```tsx
import MedicalImaging from './components/MedicalImaging/MedicalImaging';

function App() {
  return (
    <MedicalImaging
      patientId="patient-123"
      allowMultiple={true}
      onAnalysisComplete={(results) => {
        console.log('Analysis completed:', results);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## WebSocket Server Requirements

For the chat feature to work, you need a WebSocket server running at `ws://localhost:8000/ws/medical-chat` (or configure your own URL).

The server should handle these message types:
- `init`: Initialize session with report context
- `message`: Send/receive chat messages
- `typing`: Typing indicators
- `clear`: Clear conversation
- `new_session`: Start new session

## New Type Definitions

The following new types have been added to `types.ts`:

- `MedicalReport`: Complete report structure with markdown support
- `Citation`: Reference and source information
- `ChatMessage`: Chat message structure
- `ChatSession`: Chat session management
- `PastReportSummary`: Historical report summary
- `ReportFilter`: Search and filter options

## UI/UX Enhancements

1. **Floating Action Buttons**: Quick access to past reports and chat
2. **Dialog-based Interfaces**: Clean modal presentations
3. **Glassmorphism Effects**: Consistent with the existing design
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Image Optimization**: Quality settings for downloads
- **WebSocket Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple images

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Voice input for chat
- 3D image visualization
- Collaborative annotations
- Export to DICOM format
- Integration with PACS systems
