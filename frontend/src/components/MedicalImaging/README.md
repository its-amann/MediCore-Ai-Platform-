- Expandable detail sections

## Installation

```bash
npm install canvas-confetti react-countup framer-motion react-dropzone
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { MedicalImagingModern } from './components/MedicalImaging';

function App() {
  return (
    <MedicalImagingModern />
  );
}
```

## Component Structure

### State Management
- `images`: Array of uploaded images with analysis results
- `selectedImage`: Currently selected image for detailed view
- `viewMode`: Gallery display mode (grid/masonry)
- `heatmapSettings`: Configuration for heatmap visualization
- `zoomLevel`: Current zoom level for image viewer

### Key Functions
- `onDrop`: Handles file upload with particle effects
- `simulateUpload`: Manages upload progress animation
- `simulateAnalysis`: Generates mock analysis results
- `createParticles`: Creates animated particle effects
- `handleImageClick`: Opens detailed image view

### Animations
- Entry animations with motion components
- Hover effects with scale transformations
- Progress indicators with smooth transitions
- Confetti celebrations for successful actions
- Floating action buttons with continuous animation

## Customization

### Theme Colors
```tsx
// Primary gradient
background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)'

// Secondary colors
medical-blue: '#667eea'
medical-purple: '#764ba2'
medical-pink: '#ec4899'
```

### Glass Effect
```tsx
background: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)',
backdropFilter: 'blur(20px)',
border: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',
```

### Animation Timing
- Upload simulation: 200ms intervals
- Analysis simulation: 3s duration
- Particle animation: Continuous
- Hover transitions: 0.2-0.3s
- Card flip: 0.6s with spring

## Mock Data Structure

### ImageData
```typescript
interface ImageData {
  id: string;
  file: File;
  preview: string;
  analysis?: AnalysisResult;
  uploadProgress: number;
  isAnalyzing: boolean;
}
```

### AnalysisResult
```typescript
interface AnalysisResult {
  diagnosis: string;
  confidence: number;
  heatmap?: string;
  findings: Finding[];
  statistics: Statistics;
}
```

## Browser Support
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Note: Backdrop filter effects require modern browser support.

## Performance Considerations
- Images are lazy-loaded for optimal performance
- Particle effects are rendered on canvas for efficiency
- Animations use GPU acceleration
- React.memo could be added for further optimization

## Future Enhancements
- Real API integration for image analysis
- Export functionality for reports
- Multi-language support
- Collaborative features
- Advanced filtering options
- Batch processing capabilities
